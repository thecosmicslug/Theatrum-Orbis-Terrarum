This Add-On for Theatrum Orbis Terrarum (Carthoge Reloaded) makes border visibility dynamic, depending on the zoom level.

Province borders
Will start to fade out when country names appear, full transparency a bit after unit icons disappear.

State borders
Will start to fade out later than province border.

Sea province borders
Will fade out to full transparency a bit later than province borders.

Country borders
Will become more visibe when zooming out. Basically thick dark borders when zoomed out, Dark borders with golden ornaments when zoomed in.

Rivers
Will also fade out, but not to full transparancy.

Ironman and achievement compatible. Can be used with any other Add-On or as a standalone mod (sea province borders will be hard to spot with the vanilla water). Can also be used with all versions of Rev. Borders Mod (replaces RBM borders).

Special Thanks to El Kebabini for the idea to make province borders fade out which made me pick up this project again.
