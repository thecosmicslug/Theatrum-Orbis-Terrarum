Following the release of v1.29 [i][b]Theatrum Orbis Terrarum[/i][/b] no longer worked, the original author had not updated it. I have never made a mod for EU4 before, so it may not be perfect but it no longer crashes & the code has been put online in the hope other people can help me keep this mod collection going.
Even more mods from the collection broke with the v1.30 update, so I fixed them also and decided to put the whole collection offline, even the working ones just incase the original author ever takes them offline.

The original mod by @Kyro can be found at: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=570256235

Theatrum Orbis Terrarum translates to "Theatre of the World" and is considered to be the first true modern atlas. It was created in 1570 by flemish cartographer Abraham Ortelius. This mod tries to bring its look and feel to Europa Universalis IV.

Works with EU4 1.30.* | [img]https://github.com/thecosmicslug/Theatrum-Orbis-Terrarum/raw/master/BACKUP/images/ironman.png[/img] | No checksum change

    Turning off Post Effects in the option menu will lead to a slightly different look. (a bit darker, no season effects, even less shadows)
    You can turn off the trees in in the option menu
