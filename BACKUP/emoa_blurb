This Add-On for Theatrum Orbis Terrarum makes the mapmodes much more colorful and has almost no dynamic transparency. Choose either this, [b]"More Opacity"[/b] or [b]"Medium Opacity"[/b].

Ironman and achievement compatible. Can be used with any other Add-On (except for "More Opacity" and "Medium Opacity").

Special Thanks to
[b]Negi[/b] for the magic code that makes transparency dynamic and his effort on porting it to 1.19.
