This Add-On for Theatrum Orbis Terrarum (Carthoge Reloaded) makes the mapmodes much more colorful and has almost no dynamic transparency. Choose either this, "More Opacity" or "Medium Opacity".

Ironman and achievement compatible. Can be used with any other Add-On (except for "More Opacity" and "Medium Opacity").

Special Thanks to
Negi for the magic code that makes transparency dynamic and his effort on porting it to 1.19.
