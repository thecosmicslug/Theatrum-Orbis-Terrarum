This Add-On for Theatrum Orbis Terrarum makes the mapmodes more colorful and has just a little dynamic transparency. (more colorful than [b]"More Opacity"[/b] but less colorful than [b]"Even More Opacity"[/b])

Ironman and achievement compatible. Can be used with any other Add-On (except for [b]"More Opacity"[/b] and [b]"Even More Opacity"[/b]).

Special Thanks to
[b]Negi[/b] for the magic code that makes transparency dynamic and his effort on porting it to 1.19.
