This Add-On for Theatrum Orbis Terrarum (Carthoge Reloaded) makes the mapmodes more colorful and has just a little dynamic transparency. (more colorful than "More Opacity" but less colorful than "Even More Opacity")

Ironman and achievement compatible. Can be used with any other Add-On (except for "More Opacity" and "Even More Opacity").

Special Thanks to
Negi for the magic code that makes transparency dynamic and his effort on porting it to 1.19.
