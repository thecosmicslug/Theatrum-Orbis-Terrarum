I was able to fix the mod-- It may not be perfect because I have never created/fixed an EU4 mod before, but I hope it will help until @Kyro returns to us :D

Theatrum Orbis Terrarum translates to "Theatre of the World" and is considered to be the first true modern atlas. It was created in 1570 by flemish cartographer Abraham Ortelius. This mod tries to bring its look and feel to Europa Universalis IV.
